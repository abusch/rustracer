This is a toy [raytracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) written in Rust.

The code is based on the following resources:
* [Scratchapixel](http://www.scratchapixel.com)
* [Physically-Based Ray Tracing](http://www.pbrt.org)
* [tray_rust](http://github.com/TwinkleBear/tray_rust)
* Various papers found online.

In particular, you should totally check out tray_rust as it's better in every
way, well documented, and written by someone who actually knows what they're
talking about.
